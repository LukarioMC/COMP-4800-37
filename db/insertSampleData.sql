    Difficult to Swallow

    Distinguished editors:

    I have been testing the long-believed, little-examined theory that 
    three meals a day are optimal for health and longevity.

    My data, derived from longitudinal studies during the years 1964-
    1990 of more than 20,000 health professionals throughout Italy, 
    appear to indicate that there are several optimal numbers. Three 
    meals a day indeed are indeed best, but seven meals a day also 
    provide very good results, as do nine meals a day.

    The data also appear to indicate that 37 meals a day are optimal. 
    This strikes me on the face of it as being flat-out wrong, but the 
    data are there, and I am at a loss as to how to explain them. 
    Perhaps one of your readers can offer an explanation.
